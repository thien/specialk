## Requirements

You'll need `python3`, `pytorch`, `spacy`, `numpy`, `pyemd`. You can install them via `pip3` (but you'll want to make use of CUDA so you might want to look into that too).

To make life easier, I've set up a one-command auto running program that'll deal with downloading all the necessary datasets needed. You'll need `wget` however.
